# VUO_NODE_Midi_Frequency_Scala

This VuoNode takes a VuoList input of values in Cents and outputs the frequencies for MIDI note numbers.

Included in this node is the ability to control pitchbend and bend-range.

For more info regarding Scala: http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/

And regarding the File Format: http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/scl_format.html

Currently the node is only able to accept VuoReal note values in Cents, however I intend to include make a .scl file parser if there is interest.
